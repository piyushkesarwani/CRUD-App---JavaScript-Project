# HTML, CSS and JavaScript Projects
This is my Project on Javascript. I have made a CRUD App - A to-do-list app. This app takes the todo list items as Input from the user and add the items to the list. The User also has the option to delete their Todo list Items after the completion of the tasks. 
I have not added any complete functional CSS (Styling) to this app as I think that The JavaScript Functioning is my No.1 Priority. So I have focused more on the Functioning of this app.
I have developed and Created more apps and Websites like this with HTML, CSS, nad JavaScript. I will add them as I move on these projects.
I hope that you will like this.
